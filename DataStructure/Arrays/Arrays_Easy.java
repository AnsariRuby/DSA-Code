    // 1. Duplicate within K Distance in an Array
    // Given an integer array arr[] and an integer k, determine whether there exist two indices i and j such that arr[i] == arr[j]
    // and |i - j| ≤ k. If such a pair exists, return 'Yes', otherwise return 'No'.


    // 2. Rearrange array such that even positioned are greater than odd
    // Given an array arr[], sort the array according to the following relations:  arr[i] >= arr[i - 1], if i is even, ∀ 1 <= i < n
    // arr[i] <= arr[i - 1], if i is odd, ∀ 1 <= i < n


    // 3. Sum of all Subarrays
    // Given an integer array arr[], compute the sum of all possible sub-arrays of the array. A sub-array is a contiguous part of the array.


    // 4. Stock Buy and Sell – Multiple Transactions Allowed
    // Given an array prices[] representing stock prices, find the maximum total profit that can be earned by buying and selling the stock any number of times.


    // 5. Single Among Doubles (Unique Number I)
    // Given an array of integers, every element in the array appears twice except for one element which appears only once.
    // The task is to identify and return the element that occurs only once.


    // 6. Missing Number
    // Given an array arr[] of size n-1 with distinct integers in the range of [1, n].
    // This array represents a permutation of the integers from 1 to n with one element missing. Find the missing element in the array.


    // 7. Missing and Repeating in an Array
    // Given an unsorted array arr[] of size n, containing elements from the range 1 to n, it is known that one number in this range is missing,
    // and another number occurs twice in the array, find both the duplicate number and the missing number.


    // 8. Only Repeating from 1 to n-1
    // Given an array arr[] of size n filled with numbers from 1 to n-1 in random order. The array has only one repetitive element.
    // The task is to find the repetitive element.


    // 9. Sorted Subsequence of Size 3
    // Given an array of n integers, find the 3 elements such that a[i] < a[j] < a[k] and i < j < k in 0(n) time.
    // If there are multiple such triplets, then print any one of them.


    // 10. Maximum Subarray Sum - Kadane's Algorithm
    // Given an integer array arr[], find the subarray (containing at least one element) which has the maximum possible sum, and return that sum.
    // Note: A subarray is a continuous part of an array.


    // 11. Equilibrium index
    // Given an array arr[] of size n, the task is to return an equilibrium index (if any) or -1 if no equilibrium index exists.
    // The equilibrium index of an array is an index such that the sum of all elements at lower indexes equals the sum of all elements at higher indexes.


    // 12. Two Sum - Find if there is a Pair with given sum
    // Given an array arr[] of n integers and a target value, check if there exists a pair whose sum equals the target. This is a variation of the 2-Sum problem.


    // 13. Two Sum - Closest Pair to 0 [More problems on 2 Sum in Medium Section]
    // Given an integer array arr[], find the sum of any two elements whose sum is closest to zero.
    //  Note: In case if we have two ways to form sum closest to zero, return the maximum sum among them.


    // 14. Split array into three equals sum segments
    // Given an integer array arr[], the task is to divide the array into three non-empty contiguous segments with equal sum.
    // In other words, we need to return an index pair [i, j], such that sum(arr[0...i]) = sum(arr[i+1...j]) = sum(arr[j+1...n-1]).
    // Note: If it is impossible to divide the array into three non-empty contiguous segments, return [-1, -1].


    // 15. Maximum Consecutive 1s with K Flips /Maximum Consecutive Ones After Flipping Zeroes
    // Given a binary array arr[] and an integer k, find the maximum length of a subarray containing all ones after flipping at most k zeroes to 1's.
